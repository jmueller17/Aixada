Aixada is an Open Source platform that helps people to organize an alternative consumption cooperative. It is build for managing the ordering, buying, selling and handling of products between end-consumers and local producers. This software platform has been used first in the  Aixada cooperative located in Barcelona where we self-administer over 700 products distributed over roughly 60 local, organic providers among 40 households. The platform combines a normal shopping cart application with a module for ordering products from your providers. Apart from  self-administered buying and selling it also helps to manage cooperative members, keep track of product stock, money and consumption patterns.
